Five Nights at Freddy’s (2023) | Transcript

    October 28, 2023

A troubled security guard begins working at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.
Five Nights at Freddy's	

The terrifying horror game phenomenon becomes a blood-chilling cinematic event, as Blumhouse — the producer of M3GAN, The Black Phone and The Invisible Man — brings Five Nights at Freddy’s to the big screen.

The film follows Mike (Josh Hutcherson) a troubled young man caring for his 10-year-old sister Abby (Piper Rubio), and haunted by the unsolved disappearance of his younger brother more than a decade before.

Recently fired and desperate for work so that he can keep custody of Abby, Mike agrees to take a position as a night security guard at an abandoned theme restaurant: Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria. But Mike soon discovers that nothing at Freddy’s is what it seems. With the aid of Vanessa, a local police officer (Elizabeth Lail), Mike’s nights at Freddy’s will lead him into unexplainable encounters with the supernatural and drag him into the black heart of an unspeakable nightmare.

The film also stars Mary Stuart Masterson as Mike’s icy Aunt Jane; Kat Conner Sterling as Abby’s caring babysitter, Max; and Matthew Lillard as Steve Raglan, Mike’s smug career counselor.

Five Nights at Freddy’s is directed by Emma Tammi and is written by Scott Cawthon, Emma Tammi and Seth Cuddeback.

MIKE: Abs.

Come on. I know you’re in there. Let’s go.

Abby, come on.

Okay, okay.

You’re being a jerk.

You know I have somewhere I have to be.

Come on, let’s go. Five minutes.

JEREMIAH: “And though the dreamer remains asleep, he walks through memory as if experiencing it for the first time anew, no longer a passenger but an active participant.”

(chuckles)

This stuff for real?

Some people think so.

Guess it depends on what you believe.

Summer of ’82, I traded a mint condition Cal Ripken Jr. rookie for a used copy of “Missile Command.”

That card’s probably worth 800 bucks now.

I wish I could participate in that memory and actively kick my own ass.

Can I keep it?

No.

WOMAN: I would like the walnut fudge, but I want the fudge on the side because I don’t want it to melt the ice cream.

And can I get some whipped cream on top and three cherries?

CINDY: Coming right up.

Hey.

You want your usual, right?

Uh, yeah.

So, when are you gonna bring your sister by?

We got this new flavor, Rainbow Explosion.

I bet she’ll go crazy for it.

You beat up a man in broad daylight.

That was a mistake. Um…

It was a misunderstanding. I-I thought…

Just look at your employment record.

Tire Zone, sales associate, two months, terminated.

Insubordination.

Media World, custodial staff, one week.

It’s like you’re not even trying here, yet you sit before me asking for help.

I am just trying to figure out who you are, Mr. Michael Sh…

Hmm.

Coffee?

Sorry?

Uh, would you, would you like some… some coffee? I made some coffee.

No.

I’m-I’m gonna be brutally honest with you here, Mike.

Given your track record, your options… are gonna be extremely limited.

I’ll take anything, okay? Any-any job you got.

No. No.

Look, I-I-I get that part. Um, it’s just…

You know, it’s not that easy.

Yeah. Thank you.

I have a job for you.

Come on, sit down.

Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

Okay, uh, well, what is it?

It’s a security gig.

Full disclosure: it’s not great.

Right? High turnover.

That’s what we call it in the business, but you get to be your own boss. Sort of.

And you only have to worry about one thing.

Keeping people out.

And-and, you know, and keep the place tidy.

That’s two things.

You want the job or not?

How’s the pay?

Not great.

But the hours are worse.

(quietly): I can’t do nights.

Excuse me?

I can’t do nights.

That’s such a shame.

Oh, right.

Perfectly normal to sit around drawing pictures all day and-and talking to magical creatures who do not exist.

Well, then, my lawyer and I will have to take you to court, where any judge with an ounce of sanity will see to it that you never see your sister again.

All she wants is the monthly check from the state.

I’m hardly fit to be raising a kid.

She talks to air more than she talks to me.

I could drop dead tomorrow, and she’d be too busy drawing to even notice.

Before we learn to speak, images are the most important tool we have for understanding the world around us.

Me.

Mm-hmm.

We had a deal.

Yeah, that you were gonna find me hard proof of criminal endangerment.

Instead, you’ve told me what a nice kid my niece is and that my nephew sleeps a lot.

He really does, though.

Sleeping is not a crime.

Is that guy okay?

I just realized I shouldn’t be hearing any of this.

As a matter of fact, I shouldn’t be here at all.

Sit down, Doug.

So, I guess we’re finished here, unless either one of you has a brilliant idea, which I realize is highly unlikely.

Why don’t we just kill him?

(Doug sighs)

Tempting. But no.

What else?

Mike was saying that… he really needs this new job to, like, look good on paper for the judge or something.

Well, that’s all very fascinating, honey, but I am not hearing a plan.

We toss the place.

Go on. -Well, he’s a security guard, right?

His job is to make sure nobody gets in.

So, we get in, and we mess up the place good.

We help ourselves to whatever we find along the way.

Your nephew gets canned.

They help me sleep.

It’s written on the bottle.

It’s called criminal negligence.

‘Cause the moment I file that report, it’s out of my hands.

You want to take a walk?

So I used to have a brother.

His name was Garrett.

(sighs) And when I was… about 12, he was, uh, he was taken.

And I was there when it happened.

They never found the guy who did it, and they never found my brother.

So there’s this theory that, uh, we can’t forget things.

Basically, it says that every single thing that you see in your entire life, down to the tiniest of details, gets stored inside of you.

You just have to know how to look.

Your brother…

You think you saw who took him?

I know I did.

And I know that he’s in here, but he’s just… he’s…

It’s buried.

So every night, I dream, and I go back to that same memory, and I-I search for details.

For any little thing that got overlooked.

Yeah.

And that’s usually the part where people tell me I’m crazy.

I know what crazy looks like, Mike.

This isn’t it.

Not even close.

And these?

I mean, going back to the same dream, the same place night after night, it’s not easy, so the-the pills help.

Some other things, like familiar sights, familiar sounds.

“Pining for fun?”

(chuckles)

“Visit Nebraska.”

(laughs)

Your sister seems cool.

So it’s just the two of you?

Yeah.

Yeah, it’s just us.

Our mom died a little while back.

And Dad, he couldn’t handle it, so…

You know what’s crazy is, uh, when… when Garrett and I were kids, they were like those perfect parents you’d see on old TV shows.

Yeah, ev-every night, we would sit down together, we’d have family dinner, and we’d hold hands and say grace, and…

That actually sounds really nice.

Yeah, at the time, I thought it was really cheesy.

But then it’s gone.

You and Abby, you still have each other.

From where I sit, I’d say you’re lucky.
